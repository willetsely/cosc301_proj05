COSC 301 Project 5, Fall 2013: Amazon S3-backed File system
===========================================================

Due Thursday, 12 December 2013, 23:59:59
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the last project, you will build a fully-functional filesystem that stores
file and directory content and metadata on the Amazon S3 storage system. Your
filesystem will integrate with Linux using the FUSE library.  Since you will
use FUSE in this project (and because of other dependencies), you *must* use
Linux for this project.

There are two stages of functionality with this project.  Your quality of
life will be improved if you follow the order of stages and fully test and
debug the code in each stage before moving on to the next one.  You are also
very strongly advised to commit frequently using ``git``, and to carefully
manage your code so that you can always roll-back to a prior stage of
development if something goes wrong.  This project will be the most
challenging one of the semester, so a little bit of planning and setup up-
front will be worth it.

As with prior projects, you are welcome and encouraged to work with someone
else.  Please make a comment in your code to indicate who you worked with or
who you got help from.  Project submission is the same as with past projects:
you'll need to keep your code in ``git`` and submit the repository name.

To get started, fork the git repo at <https://github.com/jsommers/cosc301_proj05>, and clone to your local workspace.

Overview of Amazon S3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Amazon's S3 service, or "Simple Storage Service", is a widely used cloud-based
storage system.  Users of S3 pay for transferring bytes in and out of S3, and
for the storage of objects on S3.

The storage model is quite simple: all data are organized into **buckets**,
and buckets contain **objects**.  An object is the fundamental storage entity
in S3.  Each object must be uniquely identified within a bucket by a key (a
name).  So, the combination of the bucket name and the object key/name
identifies a single object in S3.  S3 is sometimes termed a "key-value" store,
because each item in a bucket is composed of a key-value pair (where the value is
an object).  S3 objects also have version numbers, but we will not be
concerned with those in this project.

For this project, each of you will be assigned your own S3 bucket.  Within
this single bucket you will store directory data, file data, and all metadata.
Since you will be working within a single bucket, each item in the bucket must
have a unique key/name.  Conveniently, the name ``"/a/path/to/a/file.txt"``,
which represents a file path name, is also a valid key.  This observation is
key (yes, pun intended) for successfully completing this project. 

You will be provided with a set of functions (a library) that abstracts many
of the details of using S3.  You will simply need to call functions in this
library to retrieve (``get``), store (``put``), and (``remove``) objects from
a bucket (along with a few other calls).

Overview of FUSE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*FUSE*, or "Filesystems in User SpacE", is a Linux-based system for
implementing a complete file system as a user-space program.  We'll use FUSE
to tie together the Linux file system and Amazon S3.  We'll call the
filesystem you create "``s3fs``".

The way FUSE works is as follows: your user-space program that implements s3fs
must register itself with an in-kernel FUSE component.  Upon registration, a
new subtree of the file system is created and "mounted".  For example, you
might create a subdirectory called ``mnt`` inside your project directory
(e.g.,  ``s3fs-project``).  If you start up your user-space s3fs program to
use the ``./mnt`` subdirectory as a "mount point", then any I/O actions to
files or directories (read, write, remove) within that subdirectory will first
be directed into the kernel.  The in-kernel file system (and kernel FUSE
component) will figure out that the action needs to be routed to your program.
Your program will then receive a **callback** (i.e., a function you register
in your program will get invoked by FUSE).  Your s3fs code will
then translate those actions into Amazon S3 actions, and interpret and pass
back any results.  The figure below gives an overview of this process.

.. figure:: s3fsoverview.pdf

Your main tasks for this project are to:

  1. Design how you want to store file data, directory data, and metadata
  using the Amazon S3 key-value store (in your bucket). (One suggested design
  is described below, though you can implement a different design if you
  want.)

  2. Implement and register FUSE callbacks to handle actions like ``mkdir``,
  ``rmdir``, ``getattr`` (like ``stat``), and other calls, translating those
  calls into appropriate Amazon S3-related actions.

Project Setup in Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before describing a simple design for storing filesystem data on S3, and
implement FUSE callbacks, here are details on getting an environment set up in
a Linux virtual machine.  As noted above, use of Linux for this project is
non-negotiable.  I'd also strongly suggest that you use a virtual machine
environment for development rather than the lab Linux machines, since you will
be able to do anything as ``root`` if necessary.  (You shouldn't need to, but
just in case...)

.. First, fork and clone the git repo for this project on github.  The  repo for
.. this project is available at: <http://github.com/jsommers/cosc301-proj4-s3fs>.
.. On github, you can fork the project (which will make a new repo in *your*
.. account), then clone your new repo to your linux virtual machine for further
.. work.  (The code for this project is also available as a subfolder within the
.. ``cosc301ware`` repo, but forking and cloning will probably be easier for
.. getting started.)

You should have received an email with your Amazon S3 credentials in
the form of a file named ``env.sh``.  (I have emailed or will email each of
you a separate ``env.sh`` containing your bucket name and credentials.) Save
this file in your project folder.  **Please do not add this file to your git
repo**: it contains sensitive/secret information about your S3 access. If you
want to be sure that git ignores the file, you can create a text file named
``.gitignore`` in your repo and add the line ``env.sh``.

Next, install a couple additional Ubuntu packages required for the Amazon S3
library that your code will indirectly use::

    $ sudo apt-get install libcurl3-gnutls-dev libxml2-dev libfuse-dev

(``libfuse-dev`` should already be installed.  The above line will ensure that
that's the case.)

Next, there should be a subfolder named ``libs3-2.0`` in your repo.  ``cd``
into that directory and type ``make``.  Once compilation is done, type ``sudo make
install`` then ``cd ..`` to get back to the main directory of your repo.

Now, type ``. ./env.sh`` to have your shell "source" (read) the contents of
the file ``env.sh``.  Type ``env | grep S3``.  You should see something like::

    S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKkasdf323kasdf
    S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=234jalskdjflajsjfiwhefiahsdf
    S3_BUCKET=edu.colgate.cosc301.username

(Note that your secret s3 information - key ID and secret access key - will be
different (the ones above are garbage).  Note also that the last line should
list your username as the last component in the ``S3_BUCKET`` name.)

If all that worked, try one more test to verify you're up and ready to go::

    $ s3 list $S3_BUCKET

This command should use the ``s3`` program (installed as part of compiling and installing ``libs3-2.0``) and list the contents of your bucket on S3.  It should be initially empty, but the command should still succeed.

If you type ``make`` in your project folder, the skeleton code for your file system, as well as a test program named ``libs3_wrapper_test`` will be compiled.  Running the latter program (``./libs3_wrapper_test``) will cause some actions to take place with your bucket (a little object is written, then read back, then removed).

**Please note**: before you use Amazon S3 in testing, you will *always* need to type ``. ./env.sh`` to set up your shell environment.  You'll need to do this for every shell you're testing in.

A Suggested Filesystem Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is one suggestion for how to organize directory data, file data, and metadata on S3.  You do not need to follow this structure; it is merely a suggestion.

One thing to note before the design is described is that when you mount your s3fs filesystem, most callbacks you get from FUSE include the path name of the file or directory involved in the I/O operation.  The path given in the callback is relative to the mount point that you use when initializing your s3fs program.  So, for example, if you mount your s3fs filesystem on ``/home/jsommers/proj4-s3fs/mnt``, and your working directory is the project folder ``proj4-s3fs``, when you type ``ls -l``,  your program will get a callback for the path ``"/"``, since the "root" of your filesystem is referenced from the  containing folder. All paths that you receive as parameters to callbacks will start with ``"/"``, and will be relative to the mountpoint.

In the example design described here, every name in the file system, e.g., ``"/x"`` is represented by some object in your S3 bucket.  If the name refers to a directory, the data object stored on S3 will contain information about 1 or more directory entries (the current directory, as well as any other items contained within that directory).  If the name refers to a file, the S3 object will contain the raw file data.

Each directory entry contains a name, a type (whether the entry refers to a file, a directory, or if the entry is unused), and metadata.  The metadata include items such as the file size, access and modification times, owner, permissions, etc.  You will need to decide exactly what metadata you want to store, but I suggest you look at the man page for ``stat`` (``man 2 stat``) for the metadata available from that system call (in the ``struct stat`` structure) as a guide for what you should/could include.  A convenient way to implement this design is to treat directory data as an array of C ``struct``.  For example::

    typedef struct {
        char type;          // file, directory, or unused
        char name[256];     // reasonable upper-bound on a name
        // metadata items would go here, too
    } s3dirent_t;

A few key points about this design:

  * For every directory object you store on S3 (i.e., as an array of
    ``s3dirent_t`` objects), the first entry should always be for the current
    directory, and have the name ``"."``.

  * You should *not* have a fixed upper limit on the number of entries in a
    directory.  When you retrieve the data for a directory, you can easily find
    out how many directory entries are present by dividing the retrieved object size 
    by the size of a ``s3dirent_t``.

  * Each directory (except for the root directory ``/``) will actually be referred
    to by two ``s3dirent_t`` structs: the parent directory will have an entry for
    it (with the directory name, and type directory), and the directory object
    itself will have a ``"."`` entry for itself.  You should only store the
    metadata for the directory in *one* place.  I would strongly suggest storing
    these metadata in the ``"."`` entry.


With a simplistic design like this, determining whether a given name refers to
a file or a directory requires possibly two lookups (object retrievals) from
S3.  First, we split the name into two components: everything up to the last
slash (``/``) is the first component, and everything after the last slash is
the second component.  Linux provides two built-in functions for obtaining
these two items: the ``dirname()`` function can return the first item, and the
``basename()`` function returns the second item.  (Read the ``man`` pages for 
these functions - they have good and useful examples in them.)

For example, say you got a callback to get the file attributes for ``"/x"``.
Up front, you don't know whether this name refers to a file or to a directory.
What you can do is first split the name into a directory component and a
basename component (``/`` and ``x``, respectively).  Next, look up the
directory object for the directory name (``/``).  Assuming this object exists
(and it's the root directory, so it had better exist!), search the list of
directory entries for the name ``x``.   If the entry doesn't exist, you should
return an error.  If it does exist, you can find out from the directory entry
whether the name ``/x`` refers to a file or a directory. If it is a file, you
can retrieve the file attributes directly from the directory entry. If ``x``
refers to a directory, you can retrieve the object named ``/x`` on S3, which
should contain directory entry data.  The entry for ``.`` should have the
metadata you are looking for.

The diagram below depicts this process:

Existing source code, running, and debugging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A list of the (important) source files in the project directory and what's in them is described below:

``s3fs.h``
    The main header file for your code.  You should define your ``s3dirent_t`` structure here, as well as any other data type definitions or constants.

``s3fs.c``
    All the callbacks for your filesystem can be implemented here.  There are skeleton functions already coded for maximum set of callbacks that you need to handle.  (There are different stages of implementing these callbacks that you should follow.  See below for more discussion on that.)  A ``main`` skeleton function is already coded.  

``libs3_wrapper.h``
    This header file contains the function prototypes for interacting with Amazon S3.  The header file contains explanations for each function, and there is also a short sample program (``libs3_wrapper_test.c``) that shows examples of using these functions. **Reading the code in this sample program will help for understanding how to use s3 from your code.**

There is also a ``Makefile`` provided that can build your filesystem program.
Just typing ``make`` should do it.  In fact, you should be able to compile and
start up your filesystem even without adding any new code.  (The
``libs3_wrapper_test`` program is also compiled for you to test with.)  Once
you do that, you can start things up by typing::

    $ ./s3fs -d ./mnt

The ``-d`` option puts your filesystem in *debugging* mode, which basically
means that you will see quite a bit of output from FUSE, and you can
additionally write ``printf`` statements to show debugging output.  If you do
not supply the ``-d`` option, your program will start as a "background" job,
and you will not see any ``printf`` output.  For that reason, you should
always test using the ``-d`` option.

You can type ``Ctrl+C`` to stop your ``s3fs`` program.  This should unregister
your filesystem from FUSE as a byproduct.  If your program unexpectedly
crashes, you will need to "unmount" your filesystem from the OS.  Just type
``fusermount -u ./mnt`` to unmount it.  (Otherwise, you won't be able to start
your program again for testing.)

To test different callbacks in your filesystem, just use built-in Linux programs
to provoke different callbacks.  For example, ``ls`` will cause a callback for
``opendir``, ``readdir``, and ``releasedir``, as well as to ``getattr`` (get file or  
directory attributes).  Indeed, just getting a simple ``ls -l`` to work correctly should 
be your first goal.  After that, you can try to create a new directory (and do another
``ls -l``).  You should also follow the project stages described below, which
are aligned with the process described here (i.e., getting ``ls`` working, then
``mkdir``, etc.)

Development Stages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To help manage the complexity of this project, you should proceed in stages.
Each of the 3 stages below includes the portion of credit you can earn (at
maximum) for reaching that stage.  The skeleton file ``s3fs`` has some more
information about each callback function to implement.

Stage 1 (worth 80 out of 100 points)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the initial stage of this project, you will need to handle file system
initialization, destroying the file system, getting attributes (metadata) for
a directory or file, reading directory data, and creating/removing new
directories.  No files are involved in the project for this first stage.  Each
of the callbacks you will need to implement are described below.  For now, you
should implement the functions in the most naive way possible.  (Strange
advice, I know.)  Don't try to be efficient.  Just go for correctness.

``fs_init``
    Initialize the file system.  At initialization you should **completely destroy everything   in the bucket**.  There is a ``s3fs_clear_bucket`` function in ``libs3wrapper.h`` to do this.  You should then create a directory object to represent your root directory, and store that on S3.

``fs_destroy``
    This function is called when the filesystem is shut down, so you should clean up anything you need to and go away.  You probably will not need to modify this
    function.

``fs_getattr``
    Given a path name, return metadata information about the named directory or file.

``fs_opendir``
    Open a directory.  Hint: don't do anything in this function except check whether the named directory exists.  

``fs_readdir``
    Read the entries of a directory object.  This function is a little weird in that one of the callback function arguments is a pointer to a function named ``filler`` (of type ``fuse_fill_dir_t``) and a buffer (``buf``) for filling in directory items.  Inside ``fs_readdir``, you should retrieve the directory object, then set up a ``for`` loop in which you call the ``fill`` function for every item in the directory.  For example::

        // objsize is the size of the retrieved directory object
        int numdirent = objsize / sizeof(s3dirent_t);
        int i = 0;
        for (; i < numdirent; i++) {
            // call filler function to fill in directory name 
            // to the supplied buffer
            if (filler(buf, dir[i].name, NULL, 0) != 0) {
                return -ENOMEM;
            }
        }


``fs_releasedir``
    Close (release) an open directory.  Hint: don't do anything except return success.

``fs_mkdir``
    Create a new directory.  You should check whether the directory already exists (and return ``-EEXIST`` if that's the case).  Otherwise, create a new directory object, and a new directory entry in the parent directory.

    Note that the permissions (mode) for any directory *must* include ``S_IFDIR`` (defined in ``sys/stat.h`` --- see man 2 stat).  You'll notice that at the top of the mkdir callback, there's already a line to explicitly do a bit-wise OR operation to ensure that that bit is part of the mode.

    In your initialization of mode (i.e. part of your metadata) for your root directory, a reasonable setting is::

        mode_t mode = (S_IFDIR | S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IXUSR);
    
    (The macros are defined in ``<sys/stat.h>``, again see ``man 2 stat``.) 

``fs_rmdir``
    Remove an existing directory.  Only remove the directory if there are no entries other than ``"."`` (i.e., the directory is empty).  Remember to remove the directory entry in the parent directory object.

Stage 2 (worth 20 out of 100 points)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For this stage, similar advice as in the first stage.  Go for correctness and
ignore efficiency.

``fs_mknod``
    Create a new file.  This callback should only create an empty file.  That's it.

``fs_open``
    Open an existing file.  Hint: similar to ``opendir``, just check whether the named file exists.  Don't do anything else.

``fs_read``
    Read file data.  You'll be passed a buffer to fill data in to, the amount of data to read, and the "offset" (number of bytes from the beginning of the file) to start reading from.

``fs_write``
    Write data to a file.  Similar to ``fs_read``, you'll be passed a buffer with
    data to write to a file, the number of bytes to write, and the offset from the beginning of the file for writing.

``fs_release``
    Equivalent to closing the file.  If you take the path of least resistance, you shouldn't do anything in this file except return success.

``fs_rename``
    Rename a file.

``fs_unlink``
    Remove (unlink) a file.

``fs_truncate``
    Truncate a file (remove its contents, turning it into a zero-length file).

``fs_ftruncate``
    Truncate a file (remove its contents, turning it into a zero-length file).
    (The difference with ``ftruncate`` and ``truncate`` is that ``ftruncate`` is for truncating an open file.  You can treat these calls as identical.)

``fs_access``
    Check access permissions for a file.  In the template code, this function is
    set up initially to return success (0), even though that's not necessarily true.

    **For 5 points bonus**, you can fix this callback so that it properly checks permissions.  This function is pretty hard to write correctly.  See ``man 2 access`` for the meaning of this system call and how it should behave.


.. Stage 3 (worth 10 out of 100 points)
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Besides implementing the following callback functions, you'll need to do some
.. *caching* of data in your file system to make it somewhat efficient.  If you
.. take a very simple approach for stages 1 and 2, you will simply do each action
.. as it comes without keeping any additional state in your file system.  At this
.. stage, you should try to improve on that by caching data so that you can avoid
.. making so many calls to S3 (which you will inevitably do if you take a
.. simplistic approach to begin with).  To improve efficiency, you'll need to
.. modify your ``open`` and ``opendir`` calls, as well as ``read``, ``write`` and
.. (almost certainly) other functions.  You may wish to maintain your own open
.. file table to help with improving efficiency.


.. ``fs_chmod``
..     Change permissions for a file.

.. ``fs_chown``
..     Change the owner and group of a file.

.. ``fs_utime``
..     Update metadata timestamps for a file.

.. ``fs_flush``
..     Flush file system cache data to permanent storage (i.e., S3).

.. ``fs_fsync``
..     Flush individual file contents from cache, writing back to permanent storage (i.e., S3).

.. ``fs_syncdir``
..     Flush individual directory contents from cache, writing back to permanent storage (i.e., S3).
